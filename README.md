# Lexical-Analizer-project
A lexical analyzer program implements tokenization and parsing of input strings based on predefined grammar rules. It breaks down input into lexemes, associates tokens, and builds parse trees. This GitHub repository hosts a Python implementation featuring efficient token handling, parse tree generation, and error reporting, aiding in code comprehension and development.
